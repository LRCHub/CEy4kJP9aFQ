You close your left eye and barely
breathing What kind of person are you still seeing?
You leave your right eye to follow
closely But even I know that it's not the real me
Examining your eyes Between the ever crossing lines I laugh a bit cuz
I know it's true Ah,
and don't forget that I Can only
ever hide The real me even you never knew
So tell me how to change,
point where to go Your eyes can see it all when no one
else could know That empty heart of mine I just couldn't find
So blur the dark until you find the truth I'll let you close
your eyes if you can make it through What do you really think of me?
To love me truly and share the same view We have to fix these two
eyes they gave you So lose those old things 'cuz
glasses won't do They never could see me the way I know is true
Examining your eyes I'm slowly blurring out of sight I laugh a bit
cuz it's sad but true Ah,
and don't forget you'll find Me if you
really try The real me even you never knew
They say that what you see,
you can believe We know the world is never what it
seems to be But maybe we're the same really, you and me
So now I'm sure and begging even more To please forget
the person that I was before And find the me you never see
And bit by bit I had lost that memory
A place I can't see, is this the ending?
It's always moving, you're always changing Or was it me?
Did I change and just not see?
So tell me how to change,
point where to go Your eyes can see it all when no one
else could know That empty heart of mine I just couldn't find
So blur the dark until you find the truth I'll let you check,
examine me through This is me and
everything I hide Who I am deep inside
